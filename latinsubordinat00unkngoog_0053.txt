CHAPTER VI

SUBORDmATE CLAUSES ΒΥ YEARS

THE following table shows what clauses and divisions
of clauses should be known by the High School student
in the second, third, and fourth years of the course. The
list in the Caesar column contains clauses that appear ten
times or over in the first four bookS. The same idea haS,
with several exceptions made for sufficient reason, guided
the selection in the Cicero and Vergil columns. Clauses
not mentioned in these columns occur so infrequently that
they should be mastered only when met in the reading of
the text. The teacher of High School Latin may thus be
guided to direct without waste the energy expended by his
students on subordinate clause syntax.

Some definite requirements should be made of pupils
looking toward the mastery of the necessary knowledge of
subordinate clauses and their syntax in the proper order
and at the time when such knowledge is needed most in
the reading work. Haphazard efforts along this line, with
little assistance except such as the matter in the grammars,
·difficult and mystifying as this too frequently 1s affordS,
are sure to discourage the pupil and surely will not lead
him to the desired goal.

Figures and letters refer to sections in Chapters Ι to
111, where these clauses are discussed. The detailed clas-
sification and discussion of condition al sentences enumerated
under 7 in the Caesar and Cicero columns will be found in

Chapter IV.
