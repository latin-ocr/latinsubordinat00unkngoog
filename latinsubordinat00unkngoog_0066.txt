N its present form this well-known work has been thor-
oughly revised and modernized. It ‚is published in two
volumes: one containing the first six books, the other the

entire twelve books—an arrangement especially convenient forv
students who read more than the minimum College Entrance
Requirements in Latin. Both volumes are printed on very
thin opaque paper, thus making each an extraordinarilv
compact and usable book.

ἾῙ The introduction has been enlarged by the addition of
sections on the life and writings of Virgil, the plan of the
Aeneid, the meter, manuscriptS, editionS, and helpful books
of reference.

ἾῙ The text has been corrected to conform to the readings that
have become established, and the spellings are in accord with
the evidence of inscriptions of the first century A.D. To meet
the need of early assistance in reading the verse metrically,
the long vowels in the first· two books are fully indicated.

ἹῘ The notes have been thoroughly revised, and largely added ·
to, The old ‘grammar references are corrected, and new ones
added. The literary appreciation of the poet is increased by
parallel quotations fiom English literature. The irregularities
of scansion in each book are given with sufficient explanation&
ἽῙ The vocabulary has been made as simple as possible, and
includes only those words occurring in the Aeneid,· The
illustrations and mapS, for the most part, are new and stesh,
and have been selected with great care, with a view to assist-
ing directly in the interpretation of the text.
