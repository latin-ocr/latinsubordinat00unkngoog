HIS book is designed to prepare pupils in a thorough
fashion to read Caesar's Gallie War. It contains
seventy IessonS, including ten that are devoted exclu-

sively to reading, and six supplementary lessons. The first
seventy lessons contain the minimum of what a pupil should
know before he is ready to read Latin with any degree of
intelligence and satisfaction. The supplementary lessons deal
largely with certain principles of syntax that may be taken up
or omitted, according to the desire of the teacher.

ἹῘ The vocabularies have been carefislly selected, and contain,

with very few exceptions, only those words that occur with

the greatest frequency in Caesar's Gallie War. About five
hundred words are presented in the first seventy lessons.

There is a constant comparison of English and Latin usage,

but not much knowledge of English grammar on the part of

the pupil is taken for granted. The more difficult construc-

      
         
         
     
        

tions are first considered from the English point of view.

ἹῘ The topics, such as nounS, adjectives, pronouns, and verbS,
are not treated in a piecemeal fashion, but four or five con-
secutive lessons are devoted to one topic before passing on to
another. Sufficient change, however, is introduced to avoid
monotony. The work is provided with ample reviews; the
regular exercises review the vocabulary and constructions of
the preceding IessonS, and these are supplemented by review
exercises. The last twenty pages are devoted to carefully
graded material for reading, composed of selections from ,V iri
Romae and the first twenty chapters of Caesar's Gallie War,
Book II., in simplified form.
