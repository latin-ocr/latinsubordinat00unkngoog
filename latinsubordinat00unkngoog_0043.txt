CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 3 7

be done, it will be, etc. Sequence of tenses has no influence
on the Infinitive, so the Apodosis verb changes from the
Future Indicative to the Future Infinitive in Indirect Dis-
course, futurum (esse). The sequence of tenses affects
fiet, the Protasis verb, which, as 'we have learned, always
changes to the Subjunctive. The sequence, being secon-
dary, demands either the Imperfect or the Pluperfect. fiet
is incomplete time3 hence must go into the Imperfect,
fieret. For these principles of sequence see table on p. 41.

The table on page 36 gives the Moods and Tenses re-
quired in the six regular kinds of conditional sentences
when under the influence of Indirect Discourse.

Note Particularly:

1. That there is no difference between the Real, c, and
the Ideal, d (Future More Vivid and Less Vivid) Condi-
tions in Indirect Discourse. The sense of the context will
determine the kind.

2. The Apodoses of the two conditions conceived as con-
trary to fact are identical in Indirect Discourse, but the
difference in the Protasis verb will indicate the kind of
condition.

3. The Protases of the Conditions mentioned in 2 remain
the same in I'ndirect as in Direct Discourse.
