NOTE 1.—A Relative at the beginning of a sentence usually does
not introduce a Relative Clause but is equivalent to a Demonstrative.
This occurs very often in Caesar. H. 5¹0 (453); A. 308, f (201, e);
G. 636, n. 23 B. 251, 63 ΗΒ. 284, 8: quo proelio sublati, Helvetii
coeperunt, encouragcd by this battle tlte Helvetians began, etc„ I, ι ς, 8.

Νοτε 2.-Α Relative frequently serves a double purpose in that
it introduces a Relative Clause, the predicate of which is a verb which
controls the Indirect Disoourse‚ and it itself is the Subject Accusative
of this Indirect Discourse Clause depending on its own predicate.
There are 62 oeses of this in Caesar: qnam tertiam esse Galliae partem
dinamus, whish I had said was tlte third part qf Gaul, 11, 1, 4.
