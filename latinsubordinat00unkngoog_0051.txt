INFmrrlvE TENSE EQUIVALENTS 1N INDIRECT D1scouRsss

The Infinitive in Indirect Discourse is merely a repre-
sentative of some finite form of the verb in Direct Dis-
course. It is independent of· the laws of sequence and
expresses the same kind of time as the verb for which it
stands, The Present Infinitive may stand for any tense
expressing present time, the Future for any tense express-
ing future time, and the Perfect for any tense expressing
past time. The verb in the Direct Discourse for which
the Infinitive stands is always Indicative except the Sub·
junctive in the apodosis of a conditional sentence. The
Imperative, the Indicative of a real question asking for an
answer, and the independent Subjunctives (Deliberative,
Hortatory, and Optative) of the Direct become or remain
Subjunctive in the Indirect.

Let us notice the first infinitive in an Indirect Discourse
clause in caesar: Ganos 'obtinere dictum est, it aas been
said that tlte Gauls possess (one part), Ι, 1, 17. obtinere
is present because it represents a present tense of the finite
verb in the direct discourse‚ although it depends on a past
principal verb, and is, therefore, past so far as the writer
is concerned. The direct form would be: Galli obtinent.
Again, conciliaturum (esse), Ι, 3, 22, represents conciliabo
in the direct I·t is future because it represents a future
tense in the direct.

The following table shows the various finite forms for
which the Infinitive tenses may stand in the Indirect Dis-
course. It will throw much light on the preceding dis-
cussion and will assist the student to acquire a better
understanding of the Indirect Discourse in general.
Tenses in black type are those ,with which the Caesar
student should be very familiar; others are for reference,
