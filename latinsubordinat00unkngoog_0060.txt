54 LATIN SUBORDINATE CLAUSE SYNTAX

SUBORDINATE CLAUSE ANALYSIS

The ability to resolve complex and compound sentences
into their clause elements is one that the student entering
Caesar should strive to develop as soon as possible. When
this has been done the most difficult complex or compound
sentence has become a· series of simple elements which
may be easily translated as so many simple sentences,
Such an analysis should be made by the student before he
attempts to translate any sentence of more than ordinary
length, and the teacher should have made on paper and on
the board such analyses of all difficult sentences when
they are met in the text. With a knowledge of the matter
on the preceding pages this will become reasonably easy
for the average student. Τὴει writer has found this system
of analysis, given herewith, of very great value in his work.
He has also used helpfully in the latter part of the first
year's work a regular system of diagramming such as is
used in teaching English Grammar.

We give below examples of a brace system of clause
analysis which carries out the above idea. A few details
of the plan are necessary by way of introduction:

1. Only the subject and predicate of the principal clause
appear on the diagram.

2. Only the introducing word, ‘or conjunction, and the
predicate of the subordinate clause appear, except

a) since the Indirect Discourse clause has no intro-
ducing word, the subject Accusative is given.

3. The antecedent of the Relative, and any substantive
with which a clause stands in apposition, are placed in
parentheses immediately before the clause.

4. The Ablative Absolute, being logically equivalent to a
subordinate clause, is given the same place on the diagram.
