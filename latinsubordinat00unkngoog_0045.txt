CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 39

clause (other than the Indirect Discourse Clause) with the
verb of saying to be supplied from the context, this is
called Informal, or Implied Indirect Discourse. Con-
ditional sentences under these conditions follow the regu-
lar rules for sequence of tenseS. H. 649, I (528, 1); A.
591,—2 (340-41); G· 662-3; B· 323; ΗΒ. 535, 1, a; 536, a·

The Apodosis verb, which in Formal Indirect Discourse
becomes Infinitive, appears as the predicate of the subordi-
nate clause. The Protasis verb always appears in the
Subiunctive by attraction :1 consilio ut, si possent (possu-
mus in Direct), castellum expugnarent (expugnabimus), we
will storm tlze redoubt ts we can (direct), II, 9, 11. Here
we have a Futture More Vivid Condition in Informal Indi-
rect Discourse. The Apodosis verb, expugnarent, which
in Regular Indirect Discourse would have been in the
Future Infinitive, futuros (esse), here becomes the predi-
cate of the ut-clause. Its tense is Imperfect because of
the sequence, depending on conati sunt. The Protasis
verb, being the predicate of a clause subordinate to expug-
. natent, and because of the influence of the Informal In-
direct Discourse, must appear in the Subjunctive under
secondary sequence.

Discourse, see Note 2, under 1, Noun ClauseS.

Occurrences in Caesar and Cicero:

Of the 102 conditional sentences in the first four books of Caesar, 14
are in Informal Indirect Discourse as compared with 76 in Regular
Indirect Discourse.

Of the 186 conditional sentences in Cicero, 11 are in Informal, while
14 are in Regular Indirect Discourse.

¹Cicero in several instances allows the Protasis verb in a Real, c (More
Vivid Future) Condition to appear unattracted. Cf. Man. 58, 7: εἰ dubita-
bunt, ego me profiteor relaturum.
