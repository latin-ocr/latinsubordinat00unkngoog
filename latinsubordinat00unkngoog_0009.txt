PREFACE

THE following pages are intended not so much for the
teacher as for the second-year High School student, and
as a handy reference later. The teacher rnay, however,
find here much help in deciding what not to teach as well
as what to. teach in matters connected with subordinate
clause syntax. To this end the number of occurrences of
all clauses and their subdivisions in both the four books of
Caesar and the six orations of Cicero are given. Vergil
is not taken into consideration 'here because the student in
the fourth year is supposed to have mastered these prin-
ciples of syntax well enough to devote the greater portion
of his time to other important matters, The figures given
are the result of a careful reading of the portion of the
· authors indicated above, corrected and established by ref-
erence to Meusel's Lexicon to Caesar and Merguet’s Lexi-
con to Cicer0.

Illustrative sentences are given from Caesar's Bellum
Gallicum, usually the first occurrence in the four books.
When a clause does not 'occur in Caesar, the illustration is
taken from the six orations of Cicer0. References to all
of the leading Latin grammars are given so that the stu-
dent rnay pursue his investigation further at any point.
Thus these pages are not intended to.supplant but to sup-
plement the use of the grammarS. It has been the expe-
rience of the writer, however, that studentS, with the use
of this book and the beginners’ text, do not need the gram-
mar before the third or fourth month of the second year.
