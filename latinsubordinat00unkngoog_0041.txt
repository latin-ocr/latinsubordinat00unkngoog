H· 646-48 (527); A· 589-90 (337); G· 656-59; B· 319-
22 ; HB· 534, 2; 536·

The ProtasiS, the “if ’' part of the condition, being a
subordinate clause, is always found with the Subjunctive in
Indirect Discourse.1 H. 649, 1 (527); A. 5 77, second par-
agraph3 593 (337, 1); G· 656, 656, 13 B· 314, 1; ΗΒ. 534,
2. The Apodosis has its predicate attracted into the In-
finitive (if not an Imperative, which changes to the Sub·
junctive3 or an Independent Subjunetive, eg. Hortatory,
which retains its original mood).

Let us notice the first conditional sentence in Caesar, Ι,
7, 21 ε respondit si quid vellent, ad Ϊᾱ. Apr. reverterentur, [τε
answered that {f tlzey wished anything· they should return on
tlte Ides of April. In Direct Discourse Caesar said: siquid
vultis, revertimini (Imper.), ts you wish anytlzing, come
back, etc. vultis, the Protasis verb, must, as stated above,
go into the Subjunctive. It does not go into the Present
Subjunctive because the sequence is secondary (depending
'on respondit) ; thus we find the Imperfect, vellent. rever-
timini, being an Imperative, changes to the Subjunetive,
not the Infinitive, as the Apodosis verb usually doeS. It
goes into the Imperfect, aISO, instead of the Present,
because of the secondary sequence. If the principal verb
had been Primary (Present or Future), both vultis and rever-
timini would have gone into the Present Subjunctive.

Let us· notice one other example, I, 10, 4: id si fieret,
intellegebat futurum (esse), tf tlez's should be done, lte knew
tlzat it would be, etc. Direct: si id fiet, erit, {f this slzall

1 Cicero in several instances deviates from this practically universal rule.
Cf. ,si dubitabunt, ego me profiteor relitiirum (referam), Man. 58, 7. This
is probably due to the fact that Cicer0, after he had proceeded as far as dubi-
tabunt in Direct Discourse, by a sudden change, so common with extempo-
raneous speakerS‚ changed to the Indirect.
