cum ei qui transissent (transierant) suis auxilium ferre non
possent, when tlzey wlco had crossed over were not able to

“ b) The Indirect Discourse. eo sibi minus dubitationis
dari, quod eas res memoria teneret (teneo), that less of
doubt was given him because [τε remembered these things, Ι
Ι, 14, 1. This accounts for the very frequent occurrence
of Subjunctives in Relative and 'Conditional Clauses in
Caesar, there being 72 cases of attraction in clauses of the
latter kind, and 69 in the former in the first four books of
Caesar. H. 643 (524); A. 593 (342); G. 663; 6293 B.

· 324, 1, 2; ΗΒ. 539.

Exceptz‘on. Frequently Indicative clauseS, used either
parenthetically or as unnecessary and not integral parts
of the sentence, resist this attraction. This occurs also
when the fact is to be especially emphasized. H. 643, 3,

4 (524, 2); A. 593, a (342, a); G. 629, R. Such instances .

are confined in Caesar almost entirely to Relative and ut-
parenthetical clauses of Comparison. Cicero frequently
allows the Protasis verb of a Condition in'the Indirect
Discourse to resist attraction.1 In classical prose, temporal
clauseS, especially with· dum, sometimes resist attraction
(cf. Gildersleeve-Lodge, 655, R. 33 663, 1, n. 1): cum esset
Caesar in citeriore Gallia, ita uti supra demonstravimus etc.,
when Caesar was in hz'ther GauL'as we have shown above,
II, 1, 1; angustos se fines habere arbitrabantur, qui . . .
patebant, they thought that tlzey lzad nar'row borderS, which
extended, I, 2, 18.

In Caesar there are 42 clauses that resist attraction in
the Indirect Discourse.
