Complete Edition . . . -2

  

HIS edition of Caesar’s Commentaries is now issued in
two formS. Besides the complete edition containing the
entire seven books of the Gallie War, there is also an

edition in which the first four books are published separately.
As these four books of Caesar are those generally read by
students in preparing for college, and constitute the minimum
requirements of the College Entrance Examination Board, and of
the New York State Education Department, this smaller volume
satisfies the demands in many schools at less than the usual
cost. Both editions present the necessary pedagogic appa-
ratuS, with parallel references to the standard Latin grammars.
ἽῙ The introduction contains an outline of the life of Caesar,
a description in brief of the scenes of his military operations
in Gaul, Germany, and Britain, and a short treatise on the
military system of the RomanS, together with a list of valuable
works on the subjects discussed in the introduction.
ἻῙ In the noteS, such difficult subjects as the subjunctive mood,
and indirect discourse, have been treated with,unusual clear-
ness, In the earlier books frequent comparisons have been made
between the direct and the indirect forms of discourse, and
between kindred construction& The notes to the Second Book
are sufficiently full for students who begin with that book.

Ἥ The vocabulary gives special attention to etymology, but

the treatment is made as simple as possible, with the sole aim

of aiding the student in understanding and appreciating the
significant elements of words. The illustrations constitute
one of the most striking features of the work.
