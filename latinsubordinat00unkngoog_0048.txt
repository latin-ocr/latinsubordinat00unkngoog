42 LATIN SUBORDINATE CLAUSE SYNTAX

Secondary according to the sense.l The Secondary pre-
dominates in Caesar at the proportion of three to one.

3. The Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive of the
Contrary to Fact Conditions resist the influence of
sequence.

4. Purpose Clauses (except those after verbs of Fear-
ing) have, as a rule, only the Present and Imperfect Sub-
junctive. This emphasizes the purpose, rather than the
attainment.

5. In double sequence, i.e. where one subordinate
clause is itself principal to a second subordinate clause,
the sequence often shifts from primary to secondary in
the second clause.

6. A Subjunctive Clause depending on the Indirect
Discourse will take secondary sequence if the Infinitive is
Perfect3 if Present or Future, it will take its sequence
from the main verb on which the Indirect Discourse
depends.

7. Clauses of Result often ha've the Present or Perfect
Subjunctive after secondary tenses, This emphasizes the
result. It is rare in Caesar.²
