INTRODUCTION

· ΙΤ has been said that teachers of Latin are the greatest
barriers to a proper appreciation, on the part of students
and the public in general, of the benefits and importance
of the study of Latin. This is due, in large measure, to
the frequent lack of systematic and scientific presentation
of the technicalities of the language. When such a failure
characterizes the work, the student soon loses interest and
becomes discouraged because he realizes his inability to
read his Latin without the greatest difficulty. The gate is
thus closed to the higher ends to be achieved in the study
of the language. Much has been done of late years to .
introduce more scientific methods in the Latin classroom,
but is there not further room for a simplification and an
easier method of presenting the most important matters
connected with the syntax of the language?

The first and most important field with which the stu-
dent just entering Caesar must come in contact is Subordi-
nate Clause Syntax. The ordinary text in Beginners’ Latin
brings before the attention of the student only about ten
or twelve out of some fifty classes and subclasses of subordi-
nate clauses met on the pages of Caesar. The necessary
information about these clauses and the various matters
of syntax involved are hidden beneath such elaborate
and difficult statementS, beneath so many exceptions and
illustrations in the Grammars, that the Caesar student
becomes thoroughly bewildered and discouraged. Some
simplification in such matters as Indirect Discourse, Con-
ditional SentenceS, Sequence of Tense, Attraction of Mood,
ete„ seems necessary if we expect an early mastery. Such
has been the attempt of the following pa‘ges in the discus-
sions, classificationS, tableS‚ and summaries
