Ten Orations and Selected Letters. 5125
Six Orations. shoo

HIS edition is issued in two forms: one containing the

six orations most frequently required by colleges for

entrance—the Manilian Law, the four orations against
Catiline, and Archias 3 the other giving, in addition, the Mi10‚
Marcellus, Ligarius, and Murena, and selections from the
Letters. The Murena is included because it exhibits Cicero’s
powers to a generous degree, aud with the Milo affords
material for rapid reading.
Ἥ Quantities are marked in accordance with the most modern
scholarship. The illustrations and plans have been ⁴carefully
selected to picture the environment of the orator as it was in
the Republican‚ and not as it was in the Imperial, period.
The source of each illustration is accurately indicated.
ἹῙ The aim of this edirjon has been helpfulness toward an
appreciation of Cicero and of his literary work and the
exclusion of borrowed or original erudition. Such help as
seemed to be required by the ordinary student is freely given,
but the smoothing out of difficulties which the pupil may
reasonably be expected to conquer by himself has been
avoided. Grammatical principles are enunciated as far as
possible, and references to the leading Latin grammar-s are
given. The notes contain much assistance in translation and
are clearly expressed. The vocabulary contains carefully

prepared renderings of the words and phrases used in the texts,
