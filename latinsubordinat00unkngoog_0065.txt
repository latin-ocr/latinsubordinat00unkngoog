BARSS'S THIRD YEAR LATIN

HE purpose of this work is identical with that of
Janes's Second Year Latin for Sight Reading, which it
is intended to follow. The treatment of vocabulary,

idiom, and construction is therefore much the same as in the

earlier volume, but since the pupil hus now acquired the
greater power of reading at sight, the assistance afforded in
the way of footnotes and vocabulary is not quite so extensive.

The book covers more than twice the amount specified by

the requirements.
