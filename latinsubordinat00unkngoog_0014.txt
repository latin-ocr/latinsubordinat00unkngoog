CLAusEs

Any element of a sentence containing a subject and a
predicate is a clause. Clauses are either Principal (inde-
pendent'), or Subordinate (dependent). In Latin there are
some fourteen distinct classes of subordinate clauseS, most
of which have various and important subdivisions. Alto-
gether there are about fifty such subdivisionS, the great
majority of which are'met on the pages of Caesar and
Cicero.
